## 👋 About Me

I am a **Data Analyst and AI-Generalist Freelancer** with 7+ years of experience in Supply Chain analytics and Multi-Domain Workflow Automation. My philosophy is simple: data analysis is the anchor, but it's not the ceiling. 

Beyond core data modeling and SQL queries, I actively build static websites, create Canva-based brand assets, and produce targeted social media content for small businesses and independent professionals. I focus on translating messy operational data into clean, automated workflows and impactful visual communication.
